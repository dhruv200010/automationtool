1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Are you guys a couple?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yes.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah, would you mind sharing a picture of you guys first man?

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What happened?

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We met online.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And then...

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, the rest is coming straight.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, nice.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We lived multiple states away.

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay.

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And how long you guys dated, like long distance and then the first man?

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We dated for...

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Six months?

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Probably.

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, six months.

18
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Six months?

19
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Six months?

20
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And then I moved to South Carolina.

22
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah.

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Which is where he was living.

24
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, yeah.

25
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And then...

26
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And then married for a while, four years?

27
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Three years.

28
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Three years?

29
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Three years?

30
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, nice.

31
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay.

32
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And what was your first impression of her?

33
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Absolutely gorgeous.

34
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, there you go.

35
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What were you say?

36
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes.

37
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
She was very good looking, very, very sweet.

38
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What are the nicest, most genuine humans I've ever met?

39
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Nice.

40
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And what's the story of them?

41
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Like, how did you find them?

42
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, this is our girl that we got first.

43
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is Aspen.

44
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah.

45
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Just decided we wanted a dog.

46
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I've always wanted a golden retriever.

47
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

48
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And so, we found a breeder, my cousins, and all of us,

49
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
bred golden retrievers.

50
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, we got her.

51
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then this guy, we just got, actually from Goldberg and Rescue.

52
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We rescued him in November this last year.

53
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, nice.

54
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's great.

55
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay.

56
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If somebody is getting into a relationship today, what advice would he guys have to give to the...

57
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Communications, import?

58
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes.

59
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay.

60
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Communication.

61
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000

63
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000

65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

66
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And if you guys are open sharing your name and what do you do for a living?

67
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My name is Kinsy Aminers.

68
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, my name is Riley and I'm an engineer.

69
